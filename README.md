## Detection of Characters using Image processing techniques

The goal of my optical recognition project was to implement an optical character recognition system. 
The Dectection of the characters was done using connected component analysis.
Additionally the process of recognition was done using SSD(Sum of squared distance) of various characters.

The input is a directory with an arbitrary number of target characters as individual image files.
Each image file represents a character to recognize.
The second input is a gray scale test image containing characters to recognize.

### This project was a part of the my coursework at University at Buffalo for the course Computer Vision and Image Processing.
